# FinPlanner: Autonomous Financial Planning Assistant

## 🚀 Overview
FinPlanner is an AI-powered autonomous agent designed to help individuals make informed financial decisions by analyzing their behavior, market trends, and regulatory constraints. It combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and forecasting to offer personalized and adaptive financial plans.

## 📌 Features
- 🔍 Natural language financial query answering with RAG
- 🧠 RL agent for autonomous financial goal planning
- 📊 Forecasting module for market trends and inflation prediction
- 💬 Personalized chatbot interface
- 🔐 Privacy-aware with regulatory and explainability features

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **LLMs**: GPT-4 / Claude / Mistral
- **RAG**: LangChain / LlamaIndex + ChromaDB or FAISS
- **RL**: Stable-Baselines3, Gym-style environment
- **Forecasting**: Prophet, NeuralProphet, or Darts
- **Frontend**: React or React Native
- **APIs**: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Plaid (optional)

## 🧪 How It Works
1. **RAG Pipeline**: Answers user financial queries with document retrieval + LLM
2. **Planner Agent**: Uses RL to recommend optimal decisions (save, invest, budget)
3. **Forecaster**: Predicts market trends (e.g. inflation, returns)
4. **Feedback Loop**: Learns from user choices via RLHF or scoring

## ✅ Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/islam10x/autofinplan.git
cd autofinplan
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

To run the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Multi-agent collaboration (advisor, compliance, tax)
- Plaid integration for real-time user data
- Voice assistant interface (Whisper + GPT-4)
- Portfolio optimization module
